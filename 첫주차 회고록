# 1st Week - Retrospective Essay
It's already been a week since Naver Boostcamp has started. It's been a really busy and hectic week. I felt running out of time as always. There were good things and bad things just like everything in our lives. Our time schedule is filled with rigorous learning programs followed by the peer session that is held at 16:00 and on the beginning of each day of our sprint is a daily scrum session, a term which I came across newly when I was accepted into the program. I was a novice without any prior experience with cooperative programming, let alone jargons associated with it. In fact, I had no other choice than to deal with it. WHEN LIFE GIVES YOU LEMON, make lemonade.

I am required to write a free-form essay on every Friday. I'm not sure if the old expression "too much freedom is dangerous" applies in this case, but I am weirdly uncomfortable with free-form of something. I don't blame on the freedom. I just think it is a lack of structure that comes with it. Thus, I would like to make my own format in which I would continue my journey along with. Although I have named it a retrospective essay, I will also include prospective plans and visions in my essay. Basic guidelines are as follows.
> **1. Always start with my feelings.**

What years of experience has taught me is that I should always be true to my feelings whenever I begin any form of interaction. Writing is not an exception. I have no idea who will seriously read this paper, but I am at least willing to show them that although the content may be inaccurate and wrong (though I hope not), I am serious and straightforward about my views. And I will not hesitate to make it right if I have provided a totally wrong view or a misguiding information on everything that I'm writing on. I will start with my feelings and move toward more objective realm.
> **2. End with a plan**

At the end of my essay will include a plan for the next week. This was made possible because the plan for the next week is uploaded to the website on Friday afternoon. My plan includes an unordered list of things that I should be working on from now on and things that I couldn't have finished this week. Leftover from last week is always the first priority. 
> **3. Information and Duality**

This is relatively a new idea that I've come across while watching 3Brown1Blue youtube channel. The word duality is more closely related to mathematical duality than anything else. It means one true statement can be derived from another by merely interchanging two words. For example, "Two lines determine a point" and "Two lines intersect in a point" are references to the same phenomenon. For me, being able to describe a duality of some concept is the most important part of a learning process. It opens a gate to the whole new world. It is an end game of my learning plan and itself. A vector can be expressed as a sum of arbitrary vectors, but the resulting vector almost always point to the different direction.

I feel like the first week of the camp has taught me more than I could teach myself in a month. I would like to thank people who had supported me and encouraged me to apply to the program.
